To do so, the project team set up a nursery comprising of 19 open air cages and a dwelling for the nursery staff, equipped with solar system and with all necessary household items in Kogota Gorge.  The Association also installed open air cages on the plots of 11 households of Tetritskaro village, who were trained on special skills for nursing the pheasants.

The Association also received revenues from selling 44 pheasants out of 74 ones nursed. Those pheasants, preserving all the characteristics typical of Kolkhetian ones (24 in total), were kept for further breeding. They will be released from the nursery into the nature in autumn, 2013.

The prolonged visits with follow-up analysis of the achievements allowed the beneficiaries to establish closer business relations, come up with joint business ideas, exchange views about confidence-building, and overcome the post-war mutual distrust. The project provided the Abkhaz and Ossetian beneficiaries with the opportunity to meet with prominent Georgian public figures and experts and discuss various issues of mutual interest.  According to the participants' feedback, these meetings further contributed to confidence-building.

A hotline was set up, which was to receive information about problems that the media has been experiencing in accessing the courts.  The approach to information gathering and advocacy did not work, in part because the grantee was late with organizing round table meetings and conducting the information campaign as provided in the project design.  Capacity building support to the media was provided (40 individuals were trained), but with patchy success, as rather than covering the entire Imereti region, the grantee’s efforts only covered Kutaisi and Batumi (in Adjara).  The grantee has also prepared and printed 100 copies of practical guide to accessing court information, which was distributed to the trainees and local media representatives.  To stimulate wider public discussions throughout the region, the grantee conducted three roundtables in Kutaisi.  The roundtables were also organized in Zestaponi, Vani, Tskaltubo, Sachkere, and Khoni on the issues of court transparency and access to information, highlighting area-specific issues that came through the hotline, the training session and the meetings with the stakeholders.

The IDP Collective Center in the village of Tserovani accommodates a sizable group of internally displaced persons (about 6,000 households), who lost their houses and livelihoods during the conflict.  The efforts by the Government of Georgia, local civil society, and the donor community to support these individuals have been marginally successful, as the majority are still marginalized from the society at large and face multiple economic hardships.  As time lapses, the only sure way to ensure better socio-economic integration of IDPs is to improve the latter’s civic awareness and support their efforts directed toward addressing their most pressing needs.  For this to happen, it is necessary to support institutional capacity building efforts of those grassroots organizations that support or are created by the representatives of the most vulnerable groups.  With EPF support, Tserovani-based Union Side by Side was able to improve its institutional capacity, while at the same time advocating for the protection of the IDP rights and fulfillment of their needs.  The grantee, together with the local community and experienced partner CSOs (namely, the Coalition for IDP Rights, For the Better Future, and Tskhinvali House), implemented advocacy campaigns designed to foster the socio-economic integration of IDPs residing in the Tserovani Collective Center.  For this purpose, the grantee trained 12 selected leaders in civic monitoring and advocacy, as well as in project development and fundraising.  They advocated for the interests of 50 IDPs, who had various unresolved issues with public authorities, including IPD status documents, social assistance, and environmental degradation that affected their living conditions.  One of the notable successes has been in relation to the Natakhtari Beer Company, which was forced to install purification filters in its discharging tubes and clean up the environmental damage already caused by the plant.

Unfortunately, this decentralization was infrequently accompanied by education of the regional authorities, causing confusion and inefficiency at the local level.

In total, 129 community leaders and local officials participated (39 female/90 male).  Additional participatory meetings for strategic planning in Tbilisi and the regions involved 15 NGOs that work on either environmental or local governance issues, creating a forum for civic discussion.  Participants jointly elaborated several recommendations about decentralizing forest management.  During the project, the grantee conducted 26 acts of field monitoring that included monitoring of state of forests to be transferred, the readiness of local authorities for this and monitoring of the government’s policy in this field.  The findings were posted on www.greenalt.org, www.forestgeo.net  and www.aarhus.dsl.ge, which were visited by almost 500 individuals.  The grantee prepared two publications: the Manual on Decentralization of the Forestry Sector and Monitoring of the Georgian Forest Sector 2007-2008.  They were distributed in Tbilisi and the target regions, including among local governance bodies.At a seminar in December 2008, the grantee included the Minister of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources and other stakeholders in the discussion about forest management and local governance.  The discussion contributed to significant changes in the government’s forest policy, affecting the taking of inventory of local forests and defining regulations about the use of forests by the local authorities prior to the actual transfer.  Recommendations made during the discussion were given to the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources and the Parliamentary Committee for Environmental Protection and Natural Resources.  Based upon the grantee’s recommendation, the ministry created a 20-person working group to take inventory of the forests.  In December 2008, the communities trained within the project held a protest rally before the Ministry of Economic Development and demanded that auctions for long-term use and management of local forests be cancelled.  The local media covered the protest, which was also supported by the local governments of the target regions.  As a result, the Ministry of Economic Development abolished the previous controversial decree on granting special licenses for long-term use of forests for logging, which had given an unfair advantage to companies and deprived citizens of access to wood.  This cooperative action was enabled by the grantee’s training seminars and public information campaign.
