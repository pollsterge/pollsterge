      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;predicted-party-vote-share-for-august-17th-2020&#34;&gt;Predicted party vote share for August 17th, 2020&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This forecast is based on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pollster.ge/en/methods/&#34;&gt;weighted average method&lt;/a&gt;. Data come from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pollster.ge/en/polls/&#34;&gt;28 publicly available&lt;/a&gt; poll results. Proportions are calculated for  decided voters only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;/maps/parl_2020/predictions/02_august_17/weighted_average_en.html&#34; width=&#34;800&#34; height=&#34;570&#34; overflow=&#34;noscroll&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; margin=&#34;0&#34; padding=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;poll-numbers-for-four-major-political-parties-for-august-17th-2020&#34;&gt;Poll numbers for four major political parties for August 17th, 2020&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chart below displays poll numbers for four major parties since the late 2016 unti July 24th. Only proportions for decided voters are displayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;/maps/parl_2020/predictions/02_august_17/dynamics_en.html&#34; width=&#34;800&#34; height=&#34;570&#34; overflow=&#34;noscroll&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; margin=&#34;0&#34; padding=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;state-space-model-of-election-forecast-for-august-17th-2020&#34;&gt;State-space model of election forecast for August 17th, 2020&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chart below shows results of 2,000 simulations based on publicly available poll numbers. Overall, median value of simulated vote share for GD is 56%, 20% for the UNM, 8% for European Georgia, and 5% for the Alliance of Patriots of Georgia. Considering low electoral threshold, all of the parties listed above have a decent chance of passing through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further analysis of simulations show that in the current situation, Georgian Dream has about 52% chance of winning the majority in proportional voting. The ruling party also has a very high chance (95%) of passing through the 40% closing threshold that will allow GD to single-handedly form the government. Current predictions show that the chance of obtaining constitutional majority for the Georgian Dream party only via proportional voting is marginal (&amp;lt;1%). Seemingly, the party will need to concentrate on majoritarian seats to guarantee full control of Georgia&amp;rsquo;s legislature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the chances that the Georgian Dream might lose to its main rival, the United National Movement? Predictions haven&amp;rsquo;t changed significantly from the last wave. There&amp;rsquo;s less than 0.2% chance of the United National Movement receiving more votes in proportional voting than the Georgian Dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, important caveats exist: while distribution of predictions for other parties are quite steep, that is, concentrated around the median value, that for the Georgian Dream is relatively flat. This indicates to the fact that support for the ruling party is a bit more volatile and prone to fluctuations. While the pandemic response has definitely increased support for the Georgian Dream, a million dollar question would be whether the party will be able to hold up to election day.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;forecasts-for-september-18th-2020&#34;&gt;Forecasts for September 18th, 2020&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, several opinion polls were published in Georgia. Data came from international organizations the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institution as well as news media outlets Imedi, Rustavi 2, and Formula. This gave us enough materials to update our forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All surveys that are used in this forecast, were administered prior to the outbreak of Covid-19 in Georgia in early September. We do not have clear understanding how poll numbers were affected, although how volatile Georgian public opinion can get, we do expect some changes. In sum, the analysis below should be interpreted as something that reflects the situation ante, that is, a “pre-outbreak normal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As explained &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pollster.ge/en/methods/&#34;&gt;in the methodology section&lt;/a&gt;, we only use proportions that reflect decided voters, that is, those who have disclosed their preferences. On the one hand, this is due to the fact that some pollsters (for instance, Survation/Rustavi 2) only publish results that show proportions among decided voters. Next, on what we saw in previous forecasts, proportions that are calculated without undecided respondents are to a large extent accurate reflection of what the public’s voting intentions are. Indeed, we acknowledge that this approach has its perils, for instance, not accounting for “shy opposition” voters, or the uncertainty associated with relatively smaller sample size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;/maps/parl_2020/predictions/03_september_18/weighted_average_en.html&#34; width=&#34;800&#34; height=&#34;570&#34; overflow=&#34;noscroll&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; margin=&#34;0&#34; padding=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the Georgian Dream seems to have been leading a league table in our “simplistic” weighted averages model and Bayesian forecasts. Weighted averages predict the ruling party being supported by 53% of those who have declared party preferences; Bayesian model speaks about 49% support. The discrepancies between these models can be explained by the sensitivity of the latter to outliers in raw poll numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weighted averages model predicts that nine oppositional parties have chances of getting into the parliament, although all of them except the United National Movement (18%), poll between 1% to 5%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While polls seem to have not shifted drastically, our Bayesian model suggests relative decrease in chances of the Georgian Dream garnering 50% of voters. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pollster.ge/ka/previous_predictions/august_17th/&#34;&gt;While our previous forecast&lt;/a&gt; showed that the governing party had about 56% of doing so, now chances are about 48%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;/maps/parl_2020/predictions/03_september_18/model_en.html&#34; width=&#34;800&#34; height=&#34;570&#34; overflow=&#34;noscroll&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; margin=&#34;0&#34; padding=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odds of overcoming a 40% “closing” threshold remain stable and high. The Georgian Dream has about 94% chance of obtaining enough votes for single-handedly forming the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are almost negligible chances of the Georgian Dream either getting enough votes through proportional elections to have constitutional majority, or the United National Movement overtaking the ruling party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;/maps/parl_2020/predictions/03_september_18/dynamics_en.html&#34; width=&#34;800&#34; height=&#34;570&#34; overflow=&#34;noscroll&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; margin=&#34;0&#34; padding=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to our previous predictions, our models hint on the volatility of support for the Georgian Dream. At a first glance, a Covid-induced boost for the ruling party seems to be plateaued and the Georgian Dream was almost guaranteed an easy ride if elections were held in late August. Nonetheless, it is too early to call the winner, as polls open in almost eight weeks from now. As we have no information how polls shifted due to the second outbreak, and there is still enough time for the opposition (and the government) to campaign, one can argue that the fate of elections will be sealed in the last weeks of October.&lt;/p&gt;
